# Don't Get Tackled

You're Lionel Messi, and you're going up against your most fiersome rivals, Real Madrid! Dribble past the defenders and avoid their tackles at all costs!

This game was made with Python and Pygame.
Inspired by [Don't Touch My Presents](https://github.com/Gooodgis/dont-touch-my-presents), the design and concept were changed into a soccer game and certain functionality was added/changed to support the new design and concept.
